<h2>HTTP Method Handlers</h2>

<p>The following functions are available in any Resource or Instance Configuration</p>
    <pre>
    get(String name, String path, Closure requestHandler)
    put(String name, String path, Closure requestHandler)
    post(String name, String path, Closure requestHandler)
    delete(String name, String path, Closure requestHandler)
    handle( List&lt;String&gt; httpMethods, String path, Closure requestHandler)
    </pre>


<h2>Route Matching</h2>
The <i>path</i> argument may be static or it may contain variables. Any path element
starting with a colon is considered a variable. All path elements not starting with
a colon will be matched verbatim.

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>A route declared as "/user" will match request http://host:port/user
    There are no variables therefore no values will be passed to the RequestHandler closure.

<p>A route declared as "/user/:id" will match request http://host:port/user/&lt;AnyValue&gt;<br/>
    Here, the value of :id will be the one argument passed to the RequestHandler closure.

<p>A route declared as "/user/:id/grades" will match request http://host:port/user/xyz/grades<br/>
    Here, its the same as above - the value of :id will be the one argument passed to the RequestHandler closure.

<p>A route declared as "/user/:id/history/:when" will match request http://host:port/user/xyz/history/20141128<br/>
    Here, the values of :id and :when will be passed to the RequestHandler closure in order [eg. closure( id, when) {}
    ].

<p>
    As you can probably tell by now, each variable value will be passed to RequestHandler closure in order.
