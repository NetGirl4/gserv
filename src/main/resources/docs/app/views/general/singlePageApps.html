<h2>Single Page Applications (SPA)</h2>

<p>One of the main uses of GServ is to create an SPA. What are Single Page Apps?
    Single-page Apps are applications that primarily run in the browser. They use
    AJAX HTTP requests from the page to get data from services. These services
    are usually REST-based and produce JSON or XML formatted data. The main
    page of the application is never fully reloaded but rather it uses partial templates when necessary and adds them
    when necessary.
    Some JavaScript code is needed to populate the templates with the data from the services.
</p>

<p> GServ provides a few capabilities on the server-side to facilitate this:
<li>Serve the main HTML page (Static Content)</li>
<li>Serve the partial templates</li>
<li>Serve the REST resources</li>
</p>
